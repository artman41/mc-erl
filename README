You'll need an erlang compiler/vm!

How to get it running:
 1. Download (uncompress if necessary)
 2. $ python metamake.py
 3. $ sh make.sh
 4. $ mkdir log
 5. $ cd ebin/
 6. $ erl

And now there are two different types of operation. It is either a fully functional minecraft proxy server or an alpha minecraft 1.2 SMP server. To run it as a proxy server, type 
  application:start(mc_erl_proxy).
into Erlang prompt. To start a server, type
  application:start(mc_erl_server).
Full stops are required.

The proxy will be available at 127.0.0.1:25566 and it proxies to 127.0.0.1:25565.
Be aware the log files can get quite big (some 100MB).

The server runs at port 25565 (default) and can be run simultaneously with proxy server. The port and other options can be set in "server.conf".
